# Markov-chain-Monte-Carlo-Simulation_01
Consider a one-dimensional path with 101 sites. A child is hopping between neighboring sites at  times t=0,1, 2, …….... He flips a coin and chooses the direction (right or left). That means the child  moves with a probability of ½ to the right and a probability of ½ to the left. He starts at the middle  site (site 51).

Write a Markov-chain Monte Carlo algorithm to find the probability (P) of stepping on the last site at N number steps and fill out the table.
