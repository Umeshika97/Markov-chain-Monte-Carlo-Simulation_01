Consider a one-dimensional path with 101 sites. A child is hopping between neighboring sites at  times t=0,1, 2, …….... He flips a coin and chooses the direction (right or left). That means the child  moves with a probability of ½ to the right and a probability of ½ to the left. He starts at the middle  site (site 51).
